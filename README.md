# üß†  Quiz_Game

Welcome to **Quizzler**, a fun and interactive Python-based trivia quiz game that tests your knowledge with real-time questions fetched from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)! This project was created as part of a 6-month internship program focused on data handling, automation, and Python development.  <br>

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Fetches live trivia questions from an API
- üß† Interactive True/False quiz format
- üìä Dynamic scoring system
- üé® Clean and user-friendly GUI built with `Tkinter`
- üîÑ Real-time feedback on answers (Green for correct, Red for incorrect)
- üîß Uses Python OOP concepts and API integration
- üì¶ Cleanly modularized using custom-built classes

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py               # Main execution script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.py               # Fetches trivia questions via API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_model.py     # Data model for individual questions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quiz_brain.py         # Core logic for quiz progression
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.py                 # Tkinter-based UI implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/               # Folder containing true/false button images
```

## üß© How It Works

1. **Fetch Questions:** The app calls the Open Trivia DB API and retrieves 10 Boolean-type questions.
2. **Question Model:** Each question is stored as an object with its text and answer.
3. **Game Engine:** The `QuizBrain` class handles question flow, scoring, and checking answers.
4. **User Interface:** `Tkinter` GUI presents questions, score, and real-time feedback with colored backgrounds.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install required libraries if necessary:

```bash
pip install requests
```

> Note: `Tkinter` is pre-installed with most Python distributions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Project

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure you have the `images` folder containing `true.png` and `false.png` in the same directory.
